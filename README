What is MediaShare?

MediaShare is a ruby on rails application, that stores a list of media, ie music, movies, tv shows.
A user who is given access can maintain a list of their media
Other users can request sharing of these media files.

The MediaShare App operates in conjunction with a client app that maintains the database list
of media and facilitates copying to external media for transfer / sharing
